## Technologies, Libraries

In this react project, `socket.io` and `socket-cli.io` were used for data transference between client and server side.  `Express` package was integrated, also `cors` package was installed for preventing some unnecessary bugs and problems. The project's UI has been supported with `TailwindCss`.

2- Locate to server folder and use `npm install` command
